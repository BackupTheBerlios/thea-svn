This file explains how to create the THEA installer using the izPack tool.

Remember that:
==============

- The compilation system of thea create a directory named "thea" under the 
 netbeans 4.0 installation directory.
 
Installer creation step by step:
================================

1- Copy the parent directory of this file under the IzPack installation 
   directory.
   
2- Copy the directory named "thea" from the netbeans 4.0 installation 
   directory to the parent directory of this file.
   
3- Copy the directory named "platform4" from the netbeans 4.0 installation 
   directory to the parent directory of this file.
   
3- Put or update any documentation files in the "doc" directory.

4- Put or update any configuration file in the "etc" directory.

5- Put or update any fine ine the "samples" directory.

Now,the izPack installation directory should contains a directory named 
"thea-2-installer" which looks like:

 thea-2-installer|
                 |--- bin|
                 |       |--launch-thea.bat (windows script to launch thea)
                 |       |--launch-thea.sh (unix/linux launcher)
                 |
                 |--- doc (put any available documentation here)
                 |
                 |--- etc (contain config file.example thea.cfg.xml)
                 |
                 |--- platform4 (netbeans platform)
                 |
                 |--- thea
                 |
                 |--- samples (examples of classifications )
                 |
                 |--- Licence.txt
                 |
                 |--- Readme.txt
                 |
                 |--- install.xml
                 |
                 |--- thea-installer-procedure (this file)
                 
6- From this directory:
   -- Under windows:    ..\bin\compile install.xml -b . -o install.jar
   -- Under Unix/Linux: ../bin/compile install.xml -b . -o install.jar
   
   This generates the thea installer as a jar file (install.jar).
