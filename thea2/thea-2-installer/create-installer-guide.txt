1 - Edit the file : installer.build.properties and change 
    properties when needed.

2 - Call ant using the script file name build-dist.xml
    ant -f build-dist.xml
    This prepares the installation by copying the netbeans 
    platform and the thea module directory inside this 
    directory.
    
3 - Call ant using the script file build.xml
    ant -f build.xml ( or simply ant)
    
    Now the installer is created and placed at the path specified 
    by installer.output variable in installer.build.properties
    
4 - Clean generated binaries:
    ant -f build-dist.xml clean
    This cleans directory generated in point 2. and the generated 
    installer.
